#PomoFitness: Bringing Health to Every Student

Welcome to PomoFitness, a website for any student who wants to take both their grades and health into their own hands. 

Too often, hard-working students fall into the trap of letting their health slide to get good grades.

Too often, students sit all day and barely take the breaks that they need to move their bodies. 

With PomoFitness, this no longer has to happen. PomoFitness empowers students to take control of both their grades and their bodies. How? By remixing the beloved pomodoro study method. The pomodoro method involves working in 25-minute sessions with five minutes of break time in between each session. For years, the pomodoro method has been proven to improve student focus and improve the efficacy of study sessions. And for years, students have utilized the pomodoro method to improve their productivity.

There are a million different pomodoro timers out there, but PomoFitness is different. PomoFitness helps students live a balanced lifestyle. PomoFitness keeps students healthy.

Instead of having a typical five-minute timer after a pomodoro session, PomoFitness provides each user with a unique easy-to-follow five-minute workout. During these five minutes, users get to move their bodies and improve blood flow to the brain. For students doing multiple pomodoro sessions in one night, these breaks can be an incredible aid to their physical health.

But these five-minute exercise breaks don't just improve student health; they also improve each student's academic performance. Multiple studies have proven that regular daily movement yields greater performance on tests, greater retention of knowledge, and better mental health for students. 

By supporting this project, you are supporting the health of students everywhere.

Thank you for being a part of the PomoFitness movement.
